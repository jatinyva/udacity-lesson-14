Create an array called crew to organize the Serenity’s crew and set it equal to the variables below . You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

Starting with this array of prices, change the prices of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th elements in the array.

var prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];
TIP: The 1st element of any array has an index of 0.

Afterwards, print out the prices array to the console

/*
 * Programming Quiz: The Price is Right (6-3)
 */

var prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];

// your code goes here
prices [1] = "50";
prices [3] = "90";
prices [7] = "70";
console.log(prices);


Directions:
James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];
but James had this:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:

Remove "Blackberry"
Add "Yellow" and "Green"
Add "Purple"

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Colors of the Rainbow (6-4)
 */

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];

// your code goes here
rainbow.splice(2,1,"Yellow","Green");
rainbow.splice(5,0,"Purple");
console.log(rainbow);


In the Harry Potter novels, children attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belong to one of four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Each year, the houses assemble a Quidditch team of seven players to compete for the coveted Quidditch Cup.

Consider the following array.

var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
Directions:
Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team array as an argument and returns true or false depending on if the array has at least seven players.


/*
 * Programming Quiz: Quidditch Cup (6-5)
 */

// your code goes here
function hasEnoughPlayers(team) {
	if (team.length >= 7) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}

var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
console.log(hasEnoughPlayers(team));

In an earlier exercise, you created a crew array to represent Mal’s crew from the hit show Firefly.

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];
Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon", "River", and "Book". Use the push() method to add the three new crew members to the crew array.

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";


/*
 * Programming Quiz: Joining the Crew (6-6)
 */

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";

// your code goes here
crew.push (doctor,sister,shepherd);
console.log(crew);


Use the map() method to take the array of bill amounts shown below, and create a second array of numbers called totals that shows the bill amounts with a 15% tip added.

var bills = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01, 100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99, 10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22];
Print out the new totals array using console.log.

TIP: Check out the toFixed() method for numbers to help with rounding the values to a maximum of 2 decimal places. Note, that the method returns a string to maintain the "fixed" format of the number. So, if you want to convert the string back to a number, you can cast it or convert it back to a number:

Number("1");

*
 * Programming Quiz: I Got Bills (6-9)
 *
 * Use the .map() method to take the bills array below and create a second array
 * of numbers called totals. The totals array should contains each amount from the
 * bills array but with a 15% tip added. Log the totals array to the console.
 *
 * For example, the first two entries in the totals array would be:
 *
 * [57.76, 21.99, ... ]
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - each entry in the totals array must be a number
 *  - each number must have an accuracy of two decimal points
 */

var bills = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01,
    100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99,
    10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22
];
var totals = bills.map(function(num) {
   num += num * 0.15;
  return Number(num.toFixed(2));
});
console.log(totals);


Use a nested for loop to take the numbers array below and replace all of the values that are divisible by 2 (even numbers) with the string "even" and all other numbers with the string "odd".

var numbers = [
    [243, 12, 23, 12, 45, 45, 78, 66, 223, 3],
